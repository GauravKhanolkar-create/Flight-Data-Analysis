## Flight-Data-Analysis

## Overview

This project aims to perform comprehensive analysis on flight data to extract meaningful insights into various aspects of air travel. By leveraging historical flight information, we can identify trends, patterns, and anomalies related to flight delays, cancellations, on-time performance, popular routes, airline efficiency, and more. The ultimate goal is to provide valuable insights for airlines, passengers, and aviation enthusiasts to better understand the complexities of air transportation.

## Features

* **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:** Robust scripts to handle missing values, inconsistencies, and transform raw data into an analysis-ready format.
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** In-depth statistical analysis and visualizations to understand the distribution, relationships, and characteristics of flight data.
* **Delay and Cancellation Analysis:** Investigate the primary causes of flight delays and cancellations (e.g., weather, airline issues, air traffic control).
* **On-Time Performance Tracking:** Evaluate and compare the punctuality of different airlines and routes.
* **Route Popularity & Efficiency:** Identify the busiest routes and assess the efficiency of operations on those routes.
* **Airline Performance Comparison:** Benchmark the performance of various airlines based on key metrics.
